IOSTAT Extended
by Olivier Doucet
version 0.01


This tool can show iostat grouped by DRBD group, or if any, physical device.
(running on Linux only)


Usage: 
php iostat.php <seconds>

Example : 
php iostat.php 10 
will run the tool with 10 seconds aggregate.


HOW IT WORKS
This tool is reading /sys/block/xxx/stat files so there is no lock.

Specify physical device / drbd device
